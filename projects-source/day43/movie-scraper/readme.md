### What Is It?
This is a simple application to retrieve a listing of top 100 movies to watch. I used Selenium and BeautifulSoup to get the results of the page. Selenium uses a Chrome Driver to work properly at the moment.

Essentially, Selenium is used to load and fetch rendered HTML from the server, and Beautiful Soup is used to parse the HTML to get the results as appropriate.
