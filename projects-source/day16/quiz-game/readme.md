### What Is It?
This is a simple quiz game. At the moment, it is true/false questions. You have 10 questions to answer, and at the end of the game, you will receive a score.

One thing to possibly do is to expand the game to include other types of questions. Also, there are some unnecessary characters that I should remove at some point.

For now, this works perfectly fine if you choose to ignore these little issues.
