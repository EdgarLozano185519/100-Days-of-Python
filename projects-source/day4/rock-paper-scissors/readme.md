### What Is It?
This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game. You, the main player, will enter a number between 0 and 2, where 0 is paper, 1 is rock, and 2 is scissors.

### Some Notes
Shortly after coding this, I reviewed the solution provided in the course I am following. My solution does not include ASCII images (can be added), and I took a different approach which ultimately resulted in more conditionals than the solution provided.

I understand that I took a combinations perspective, where I tried all possible combinations and wrote out the outcomes which yielded 9 if/elif statements. The solution provided used a number approach, where only numbers were compared to each other, reducing the number down to 6 conditionals.
