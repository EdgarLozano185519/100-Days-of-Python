### What Is It?
This is a quiz app. Unlike the one done the first time around, way back when, this is actually in GUI form and not a console application. It pulls true/false questions from the Open Trivia API. And it works ok at the moment.

Everything should work. It is 95 percent complete I would say. However, there is one or two things I didn't get a chance to implement.

The first is giving feedback if you got a question right or wrong. But this can still be discovered by taking a look at the score. It gives you the current score out of number of total questions.

The second thing not implemented is a way to stop buttons from being clicked when the game ends. But again, this would be a minor thing. The application will inform you when the game is over at the very least.
