# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Edgar Lozano

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 19, Tuesday, 2021.

## Log

### R1D1
Worked on a program that generates a cool band name. [View readme.](projects-source/day1-band-name-generator/readme.md)
### R1D2
Worked on a program to calculate how much someone owes including tip. [View readme.](projects-source/day2/tip-calculator/readme.md)
### R1D3
Didn't work on complex program, but did two smaller programs.

I worked on a tool to tell you if a number is even or odd. [View readme.](projects-source/day3/even-odd/readme.md)

I worked on a program to tell your weight based on BMI. [View readme.](projects-source/day3/bmi-calculator/readme.md)
### R1D4
I did two programs today.

I worked on a rock-paper-scissors game. [View readme.](projects-source/day4/rock-paper-scissors/readme.md)

And I worked on a coin-toss program to test my use of the random library. [View readme.](projects-source/coin-toss/readme.md)
### R1D5
Today was fun. I worked on a simple password generator! [View readme.](projects-source/day5/simple-password-generator/readme.md)

I also worked on a tool to tell you which is the high score in a list of scores.
### R1D6
First program was written to add even numbers between 1 and 100. Nice little program to practice my math with Python.

Second program I wrote was the Fizz Buzz program to practice order of conditionals.

Final program I wrote today was a Hangman application! That was fun. [View readme.](projects-source/day6/hangman/readme.md)
### R1D7
Today I wrote a Caesar Cypher program that will encrypt and decrypt a word using any shift value. [View readme.](projects-source/day7/caesar-cypher/readme.md)
### R1D8
Today I wrote a silent auction program to display highest bidder. [View readme.](projects-source/day8/silent-auction/readme.md)

I also wrote a small program to tell you if a number is a prime number.
### R1D9
I wrote a simple four-operation calculator. [View readme.](projects-source/day9/calculator/readme.md)

I also wrote a fun little game called Treasure Island. Feel free to clone and run the game to see how fun it is!
### R1D10
Today I wrote a version of the Black Jack game! So fun. I was able to apply loops, functions, and using the random library. [View readme.](projects-source/day10/black-jack/readme.md)
### R1D11
Today was a fun guessing game! I practiced more loops and variable scope. [View readme.](projects-source/day11/guessing-game/readme.md)
### R1D12
Today I started on a complex project. I started to develop the beginning stages of a markdown to HTML converter.

This will give me an opportunity to work with file manipulation libraries, regular expressions, and more intermediate concepts. I will return to this from time to time as it may be useful in creating blog posts for a website I run.

Today, I finished working on a function that is supposed to detect when headings are found and convert them from markdown to HTML string. I also started on a function to tell whether a string contains a potential link.

I am resuming the main curriculum I've been following starting tomorrow.
### R1D13
Today I worked on a fun game that allows a player to guess which of two social media accounts might have more followers. [View readme.](projects-source/day13/higher-lower/readme.md)
### R1D14
Today I worked on a fun virtual coffee machine. It was pretty fun getting to see how I could make it without using functions. [View readme.](projects-source/day14/coffee-machine/readme.md)
### R1D15
Today, I did the exact same project as yesterday. The only difference is that I used Object Oriented Programming to deliver the awesome coffee to you. [View readme.](projects-source/day15/oop-coffee-machine/readme.md)
### R1D16
Today I wrote a quiz game in Python. I used OOP concepts to design a question class, and a quizzer class. [View readme.](projects-source/day16/quiz-game/readme.md)
### R1D17
Today I experimented with Turtle graphics, a library as part of the Python library. It was fun getting to try to draw things on the screen using a turtle. The main project was a Hurst Paiting sort of project in which dots are drawn on the screen with varying colors and patterns. [View readme.](projects-source/day17/hurst-painting/readme.md)
### R1D18
OK. I have to admit, today was kind of an easier day. I didn't exactly do full project coding, but I spent a lot of time learning about packages, modules, and libraries. I created a package containing a speech library to speak things, which might be useful to some users.

I made use of a library known as Tolk, which has screen reader capabilities.

I also worked on a sample turtle graphics program that moves a turtle forward, making use of the turtle graphics and the screen reader library.
### R1D19
I wrote a etch-a-sketch application today using turtle graphics! It just draws on the screen using a  cool turtle figure. It was a fun project! [View readme.](projects-source/day19/etch-a-sketch/readme.md)
### R1D20
The first project I worked on today was a turtle racing game. Launch the application, type the color you think is going to win, and press the r key on the keyboard to watch the race and see if your bet was correct.

The second project is part 1 of a snake game project. [View readme.](projects-source/day20/snake-game-part-1/readme.md)
### R1D21
Today I finished coding the snake project. This was a great opportunity to learn about object-oriented programming. [View readme.](projects-source/day21/snake-game-part-2/readme.md)
### R1D22
Today's program is a pong game! This was good practice with everything from loops, functions, classes, objects, and graphics module. [View readme.](projects-source/day22/pong/readme.md)
### R1D23
I wrote a fun game where a player has to try to make it across a road without getting run over by cars. [View readme.](projects-source/day23/turtle-crossing/readme.md)
### R1D24
I did a number of things today.

The first is that I added a high score system to the snake game. High scores should now carry over from game to game, if you exit the program and run it again.

The second thing is not really anything. It is just a practice with files.

The last thing I worked on today was a sort of sample mail merger program. [View readme.](projects-source/day24/mail-merge-project/readme.md)
### R1D25
Today was kind of slow for me. The main thing I did was to experiment with Pandas to get familiar with common methods.

A small project I wrote was a squirrel aggregating program that gathers how many of each color exists from a dataset provided. It then wrote the results back to a CSV file.
### R1D26
Today I wrote a game where the aim is to guess all 50 states in the US. It's kind of fun. It will then generate a file of states you missed.

I also wrote a program that will give a list of phonetic codes for a word you, the user, enters. For example, "edgar" would give something like "echo delta golf alpha romeo"
### R1D27
It has been a week since I have been able to program. Power and water went out last week, so I am just now getting back to it.

Today I started learning about TKInter in Python. I wrote a simple mile to km converter. [View readme.](projects-source/day27/mile-to-km/readme.md)
### R1D28
I wrote a Pomodoro GUI application. The program is designed to increase productivity. It has two simple buttons, a start and reset button. These buttons control timers that can be used to keep track of work and break periods for you, the user.

The common work flow for a pomodoro application is using 25 minutes for uninterrupted work, 5 minutes for a short break, and after 4 "pomodoros," you may take a long break of 20 minutes.
### R1D29
Today I wrote a Password Manager. It's a GUI with inputs and buttons. At the moment, it will generate passwords and save entries to a file. The passwords are not hidden, so I recommend not using this for super security-based applications.
### R1D30
Today I learned about errors and handling them with exceptions.

I began with adding some exception handling to my old Nato Alphabet project. It now handles input that might not be correct.

I also added another feature to the project I did yesterday, the Password Manager. It now searches for websites you might have saved. And it is now using json data.
### R1D31
Today was kind of a lazy day.

I wrote code to render UI for a flash card program. The rest will be done on day 32. Also tomorrow, I am planning to take on another project to make up for today.
### R1D32
I know, I know. I'm falling behind! But I am trying my best.

Today I finished my day 31 project, which is a simple flash card program. It works on a timer. See if you know some of the french words. If you do, the words will not come up again.
### R1D33
Today I wrote two programs. First I wrote a program to send motivational quotes (can be adjusted to send any one day of the week).

I also wrote a program that sends someone a birthday wish. It uses CSV file to keep track of people.
### R1D34
I worked on two little programs today.

The first was a simple funny Kanye quotes app. See what Kanye West has to say.

The second is a bit more serious and cool. It sends an email when the ISS, International Space Station, is right above your location. It uses latitude and longitude to determine your location. Location is not automatically detected, but if you can manage to get your coordinates, they can be filled in as constants, and you can be informed when the ISS is near!
### R1D35
Today I worked on a GUI version of the quiz application. It is 95 percent complete. [View readme.](projects-source/day35/quizzler-app/readme.md)
### R1D36
Today I was very productive. I learned about authenticating to apps, if authentication is needed, using API keys and other information.

That lead me to create a umbrella alert app. When ran, the application will check a weather api, and notify you if you need an umbrella via text message. It's a simple app, but I'm glad this gives me an opportunity to learn about APIs.
### R1D37
Today I wrote a cool app to track stock for Tesla from last two days. [View readme.](projects-source/day37/stock-news/readme.md)
### R1D38
Most of what I did today was to learn about sending requests. I learned about post, delete, put, and basic get requests. The API I learned from is Pixela, an app which allows someone to track an activity.

I learned to create a user, create a graph, and create an entry for the activity. Also, deleting an entry is learned. This program could be extened beyond what I did here, but that's what I did today. Very productive!
### R1D39
I wrote an exercise tracking app. You basically type in a plain English sentence which describes what exercise activity you performed, and the program will send that to a Google Sheet. It is more API practice.
### R1D40
I was away yestertday with some bladder thing, which was supposed to be real day 40. But I'm getting better. Today I started a flight finder project.

The flight finder project is in multiple complex parts. It is divided into classes. Today I worked on writing iata codes to a Google Sheet.

Tomorrow should be spent finishing it up with text messages and such.
### R1D41
Today I finished the major functionality of the Flight Deals application. It should send an SMS message if it finds cheaper prices than those listed in a Google sheet departing from London.
### R1D42
Today I added some functionality to our flight deals program. Users can now sign up with their email addresses, and if the flight program finds any good deals, it will send them to the users.

At the moment, it only works when flying from London. It could be expanded to work from any other city.
### R1D43
Today was a busy day! The first project I worked on was a movie scraper. I essentially grabbed 100 of the best movies to watch from a website and practiced my web scraping abilities. [View readme.](projects-source/day43/movie-scraper/readme.md)

I also worked on a playlist creator. It is kind of cool. It asks the user what date in the past from when they want to view songs, and a Spotify playlist is generated for them.
### R1D44
Today I worked on more web scraping. I worked on an application to send an email if the price of an item, a random item, has a price lower than $1500.

This could potentially be used for practically any item and price threshold. But for this purpose, I used a random gaming computer.
### R1D45
Today I worked on two simple projects. Both are designed to practice using the Selenium library.

The first project is a simple program to tell you how many articles are on Wikipedia.

The second project is a simple Cookie Clicker player. It will click cookie generator for you indefinitely.
### R1D46
Today I worked on an application to scrape LinkedIn using Selenium. This was an exercise to automate job search.

I didn't really want to apply for jobs at the moment, so the purpose of this program was just to find potential companies at which I could apply in the future. I generated a search filter for Python Developer jobs.

All one needs to do is enter their credentials into the appropriate constants in the Python file, and watch the program look for a few companies that might offer Python jobs. You could potentially use other search filters, provided they are generated on the LinkedIn website first. This shows much potential for automation. And I could certainly extend it to auto-apply to jobs for me.
### R1D47
Today I worked on an auto Tinder swiper. Well, it actually just automates disliking people. I had some hesitation doing this project, but I wanted to learn more about Selenium.

I am not actually on Tinder, but I created a throwaway account. I don't want to mess with people's feelings after all.

At the moment, a user can log in, and successfully get to the main screen to start liking or disliking users. I almost have the actual disliking functionality down. I can probably finish tomorrow.
### R1D48
Today's project was simple. I wrote a Twitter complaint bot. It complains if my current Internet speed is lower than what my ISP advertises for me. And of course, it is.
### R1D49
Today I wrote an Instagram follwer bot. You give it your account information, and a URL for a user's whose followings you want to follow, and it tries to follow all of those accounts for you.

I'm beginning to really learn more about Selenium.
### R1D50
Today I wrote an automation bot. It first fetches data from a webpage of house listings. It then aggregates that data and enters it into a Google form.

The Google form can then be used to make a Google spreadsheet of that data.

This shows both Selenium and Beautiful Soup at work.
### R1D51
Today was a simpler day. I learned about decorator functions in Python.

The main exercise was designed to slap on a decorator function that would calculate the time it takes to run each function.
### R1D52
The main program today was a Higher Lower guessing game. This was to primarily practice using Flask.

Essentially, when the program starts, a random number is generated. Then, a user has to guess a number by using URL in the browser in the form "/guess/<number>".
### R1D53
Today I worked on a simple project to learn to serve content using Python and Flask. The content served is a simple HTML page containing a Name Card.
### R1D54
Today I worked on two little projects.

The first is a simple guesser app. You go to a URL after running the flask app, and you supply it a name. Using a couple of really simple APIs, it will guess that person's gender and age. How fun!

The second app is a simple blogging application. The application will retrieve certain fake blog data, and populate a page with blog entry and "Read" links to click on. The links take you to a page with the full text for that blog.
### R1D55
Today's program is a remastered version of the blog I did yesterday. In today's blog site, I added a header and footer pages that can be included in nearly all pages to generate consistent pages. It also uses Bootstrap, a popular styling library.
### R1D56
Today I updated the contact form from yesterday's blog. Now, it actually does send an email when the form is submitted. How fun!

I also zipped up both today's and yesterday's project to conserve some space.
### R1D57
Today I wrote a simple application that experiments with WT Forms and Flask. I created a simple Login form with two fields and validation takes place on submit.
### R1D58
Today I worked on a simple application that uses a CSV file as a simple database. One of the pages in the app will render all the entries in the CSV file as a table. Another route will allow you to add an entry via a form.

Happy cafe search!
### R1D59
Today I wrote a simple book shelf website to practice CRUD operations with Flask and SQL Alchemy. You can add, view, update rating, and delete books from the bookshelf.
### R1D60
Today I worked on a Flask application to display top movies. It's an application to practice CRUD operations using Flask, WTForms, and Bootstrap.
### R1D61
Sorry, but I was away for the weekend, so didn't really work on anything for a couple days. Sorry, not sorry! :)

Today I finished up the CRUD application for my top 10 movies. I can add movies and query the movie database to update my local database with information. I can also update reviews and ratings, and delete a movie from my list if I want.

I also started work on another project to learn about making an API with Flask. At the moment, it's a simple Cafe API. Someone compiled a list of good cafes in the UK, and I'm returning it as JSON data using Flask. I'll finish the rest tomorrow as today I only made /all and /random endpoints.
### R1D62
Today I finished my RESTFul API for cafes. This is to practice writing these with Flask and Python. You can add a cafe via POST method, delete a cafe with DELETE method, update a cafe with PATCH method, and of course, retrieve cafes with get requests to a few endpoints.
### R1D63
Today I added actual CRUD functionality to the blog project I worked on a few projects back. I can add, edit, delete, and retrieve posts as needed. Project has been zipped to minimize space.
### R1D64
I practiced adding login functionality to a Flask application. It is a simple application, but I did learn how to use Flask Login library in conjunction with Flask and other libraries I've been using.
### R1D65
OK! Today was a tough lesson but I'm glad I went through it. Today I put the finishing touches on a blog project I've been working on. The full blog project now allows people to register, login, comment, and past functionality of course, which includes creating, editing, deleting, and retrieving posts. This is pretty much a full blog solution, bar for the styling and other front end issues. but this was a great exercise in learning about Flask libraries.
### R1D66
No actual coding today. But I did learn how to deploy an application to Heroku. This would be considered production mode I guess? Anyway, I got a lot out of it.
### R1D67
Today I started to explore Jupyter Notebooks. I learned about cells and how code runs and I started to manipulate some college major data in a CSV file.

Tomorrow I will probably finish the work with that.
### R1D68
Today I finished the challenges for exploring Python data in a Jupyter notebook.

I learned how to get certain information out of data frames and add stuff to them as well.

I also started a new challenge with another Jupyter notebook about programming language data. Tomorrow I am going to learn to plot data for visualizations.
### R1D69
Today I finished analyzing programming languages data. I learned a bit about MatPlotLib, although, I'd be lying if I said it interested me. But I'll see how much more I can do before I skip Data Science for now.

I also decided to write a program to convert strings entered by a user into Morse Code. I didn't make the program too comprehensive, but dots (.) and dashes (-) are used and letters are separated by a space character. Multiple spaces indicate word separation.
### R1D70
Today I deviated from my plan of projects a bit. But I worked on a Tic-Tac-Toe app. It was fun to code. It is a text-based application, and "X" and "O" characters are used.
### R1D71
Ok I took a break yesterday. Sue me!

Anyway, today I worked on analyzing some information about Lego data. The lego data was collected in CSV files, and I used Pandas to analyze it in a Jupyter notebook.
### R1D72
Today I explored some Google trends data. Same as last few days, I explored the CSV data for various CSV files, explored it, and plotted it using MatPlotLib.
### R1D73
Today I worked on exploring Google Play Store data. I learned about deleting duplicate rows, dropping NaN rows from a frame, and generating visualizations from the data.
### R1D74
Today I learned about NumPy. This is a really neat library. I was able to learn how NumPy interprets images as arrays, how to manipulate arrays, how to learn information about these n-dimentional arrays, and how to use MatPlotLib to display these arrays as images.
### R1D75
Today I analyzed data for movie sales. I also learned about Seaborn to generate scatterplots and bubble charts. I will be gone for a few days, but I am picking up from here next time.
### R1D76
Today I spent more time learning about the Create-React-App world. Not much Python today. Sorry. But I got married, so that's a great thing!
### R1D77
Today I wrote a program to watermark an image. It's a GUI that gives you an option to type text to be used as the watermark text, and it adds it to an image. It was a good refresher on Tkinter.
### R1D78
Today I worked on a Django application. It is a polls application with questions and choices. This is a sample application to learn about how to develop a Django application using models, views, and templates. Today I added a few URLs that take a variable and returns appropriate question.
### R1D79
Today I worked some more on the Django sample Polls application. I added Results and Detail views and learned about the Reverse method in Django. I successfully added some choices to pick from in the question model.
### R1D80
Today I finished working on the Polls app of my sample application to learn Django. I added generic views for Detail, Index, and Results views. I also learned how to add tests to my app to ensure functionality works as expected. Due to testing, I corrected the method used to determine if a question was published recently.
### R1D81
Today I did not slack off. I was actually looking at the Earwax library, an audio game library to create, well, audio games for visually impaired.

I created a sample application and started to work on code for a game.
### R1D82
Today I worked on a Goal Hitting game. It is purely audio-based, and I wrote some good code to hit a ball. But this time, I used a library called Lucia. Similar concept as Earwax, but with simpler interface. So, I haven't been slacking off, I just haven't been following the project outline I was following before.
### R1D83
Today I continued my work on the Goal Hitting game. I started on the first steps to making an AI player. The player is able to return the ball back to me if we're lined up in front of the ball.

But before I could get that working, I made it possible for the goal functionality to work, at least if the player returns the ball to the AI.
### R1D84
Today I continued to work on my small audio game. Again, it's a small audio version of Pong, but much simpler.

I added functionality to get the goals to be hit propperly on both the player and AI sides. There was a pesky little bug, but I managed to squash it after some time.

The bug had to do with a function in the Player class, and essentially, it was doing a bit too much. So much so, that it was hard to track it down. Oh, and now the ball moves randomly throughout the game board.

Next step is to increase speed based on loop counter. And finally, I need to add it to where the AI moves according to the ball. Almost there with single player mode! I also want to add a little multiplayer mode.
### R1D85
Yay! I am almost done with the single player capability of the Goal Hitting game. Today I added AI player capabilities. Now the AI can move (probably too fast), and there is a small scoring system in place. I also added speed increase to the ball if it hasn't hit a goal.
### R1D86
Today I worked on adding boilerplate code to a client/server version of the Goal Hitting game. As of now, a server can run, as a Pygame-based window, and wait for a single connection. A screen reader library will let the user know, in text-to-speech, when a connection was made. 
### R1D87
Today I worked on the client/server Goal Hitting game. I almost have the connection bit set up, but I'm still getting connection synchronization errors. I'm trying to send information through each loop iteration, from the server, to the client. The client is trying to receive the data, but it hangs somewhere. So I still have to figure that one out. 
### R1D88
Today I figured out the networking issue! I'm excited. Essentially, the server and client have to continuously send each other messages to remain in sync. But it seems to work fine now. I may, at later time, have to investigate how to encrypt messages sent over the TCP sockets.

Tomorrow's problem is to figure out how to actually play the game with the networking capabilities. Today, I kind of have the audio sync depending on main player hitting the ball.
### R1D89
Yes I know, I've been kind of lazy last couple of days. But today, I started another little project. I know of a library to interact with Fmod, a popular and robust audio library used in low-level programming.

I took quite some time to learn how to connect it to Python and get it working. Now, I have a small program that will demonstrate basic playback, panning, and turning in angles. I know, I keep trying new things. But I do want to finish the Goal Hitting program.
### R1D90
I'm all over the place with projects. But today I returned to Django to remind myself of some basic URL and views concepts. I created a basic challenges application to show some stuff related to dynamic views and paths.

I want to start alternating between working on games, and learning about Django. The point here is to get a job using Python, and possibly other programming languages. 
### R1D91
OK. Today I officially started my AudioPaintWars project. I was going to do this in C#, but I figured Python is fine. If it turns out that Python isn't the best, then I'll just try writing it in a different language.

Today I wrote some code to initialize Pygame, a screen reader subsystem, and Fmod. These are the libraries I'm deciding to use for this project. I even wrote some code to move the player, but it's not working as expected quite yet. So I'm just testing it for now to understand movement. I'm eventually going to make it its own class.
### R1D92
As I said, I am alternating between Django and developing my AudioPaintWars game. For today, I refreshed myself on writing templates with Django.

I learned about the url tag, the for tag, and fixed the index page of the challenges app I started to work from iterating in the view to the template.
### R1D93
Today I completed an actual small program. I wrote a script to automate the creation of an HTML list based on the files found in a folder. This is because I'm working on a side project of gathering recordings of Audio Gamers.
### R1D94
Today I worked on a cool project. The site I have running for audio game recordings... Well, I wrote a nice script to generate all the files based on files uploaded to AWS S3. It was a hack of sorts, but it does a good job generating all the files needed to deploy to the server.
### R1D95
Today I did not goof off. I did some more work for the audio game recordings site.
### R1D96
OK. It has been a while since I've committed to this 100 Days of Python challenge.

This is my fault completely. However, I have been working on another project, which is on another repository. And I believe it helps in improving my Python abilities.

This project has to be kept private. So I decided not to include my updates for it in this repo.

But I took a break from the other project and am now committing to learning about Django development for potential future jobs.

Today, I started my journey on making a blog project from scratch with Django. I added a base html template, some dummy views, and am planning to work on this off and on from now on, potentially working up to a big project I have in mind.
### R1D97
I added some logic to render dummy blog entry data on the home page of our project.

I also spent a lot of time fiddling with VSCode settings. Ugh!
