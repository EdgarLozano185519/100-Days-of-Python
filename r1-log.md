The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 19, Tuesday, 2021.

## Log

### R1D1
Worked on a program that generates a cool band name. [View readme.](projects-source/day1-band-name-generator/readme.md)
### R1D2
Worked on a program to calculate how much someone owes including tip. [View readme.](projects-source/day2/tip-calculator/readme.md)
### R1D3
Didn't work on complex program, but did two smaller programs.

I worked on a tool to tell you if a number is even or odd. [View readme.](projects-source/day3/even-odd/readme.md)

I worked on a program to tell your weight based on BMI. [View readme.](projects-source/day3/bmi-calculator/readme.md)
### R1D4
I did two programs today.

I worked on a rock-paper-scissors game. [View readme.](projects-source/day4/rock-paper-scissors/readme.md)

And I worked on a coin-toss program to test my use of the random library. [View readme.](projects-source/coin-toss/readme.md)
### R1D5
Today was fun. I worked on a simple password generator! [View readme.](projects-source/day5/simple-password-generator/readme.md)

I also worked on a tool to tell you which is the high score in a list of scores.
### R1D6
First program was written to add even numbers between 1 and 100. Nice little program to practice my math with Python.

Second program I wrote was the Fizz Buzz program to practice order of conditionals.

Final program I wrote today was a Hangman application! That was fun. [View readme.](projects-source/day6/hangman/readme.md)
### R1D7
Today I wrote a Caesar Cypher program that will encrypt and decrypt a word using any shift value. [View readme.](projects-source/day7/caesar-cypher/readme.md)
### R1D8
Today I wrote a silent auction program to display highest bidder. [View readme.](projects-source/day8/silent-auction/readme.md)

I also wrote a small program to tell you if a number is a prime number.
### R1D9
I wrote a simple four-operation calculator. [View readme.](projects-source/day9/calculator/readme.md)

I also wrote a fun little game called Treasure Island. Feel free to clone and run the game to see how fun it is!
### R1D10
Today I wrote a version of the Black Jack game! So fun. I was able to apply loops, functions, and using the random library. [View readme.](projects-source/day10/black-jack/readme.md)
### R1D11
Today was a fun guessing game! I practiced more loops and variable scope. [View readme.](projects-source/day11/guessing-game/readme.md)
### R1D12
Today I started on a complex project. I started to develop the beginning stages of a markdown to HTML converter.

This will give me an opportunity to work with file manipulation libraries, regular expressions, and more intermediate concepts. I will return to this from time to time as it may be useful in creating blog posts for a website I run.

Today, I finished working on a function that is supposed to detect when headings are found and convert them from markdown to HTML string. I also started on a function to tell whether a string contains a potential link.

I am resuming the main curriculum I've been following starting tomorrow.
### R1D13
Today I worked on a fun game that allows a player to guess which of two social media accounts might have more followers. [View readme.](projects-source/day13/higher-lower/readme.md)
### R1D14
Today I worked on a fun virtual coffee machine. It was pretty fun getting to see how I could make it without using functions. [View readme.](projects-source/day14/coffee-machine/readme.md)
### R1D15
Today, I did the exact same project as yesterday. The only difference is that I used Object Oriented Programming to deliver the awesome coffee to you. [View readme.](projects-source/day15/oop-coffee-machine/readme.md)
### R1D16
Today I wrote a quiz game in Python. I used OOP concepts to design a question class, and a quizzer class. [View readme.](projects-source/day16/quiz-game/readme.md)
### R1D17
Today I experimented with Turtle graphics, a library as part of the Python library. It was fun getting to try to draw things on the screen using a turtle. The main project was a Hurst Paiting sort of project in which dots are drawn on the screen with varying colors and patterns. [View readme.](projects-source/day17/hurst-painting/readme.md)
### R1D18
OK. I have to admit, today was kind of an easier day. I didn't exactly do full project coding, but I spent a lot of time learning about packages, modules, and libraries. I created a package containing a speech library to speak things, which might be useful to some users.

I made use of a library known as Tolk, which has screen reader capabilities.

I also worked on a sample turtle graphics program that moves a turtle forward, making use of the turtle graphics and the screen reader library.
### R1D19
I wrote a etch-a-sketch application today using turtle graphics! It just draws on the screen using a  cool turtle figure. It was a fun project! [View readme.](projects-source/day19/etch-a-sketch/readme.md)
### R1D20
The first project I worked on today was a turtle racing game. Launch the application, type the color you think is going to win, and press the r key on the keyboard to watch the race and see if your bet was correct.

The second project is part 1 of a snake game project. [View readme.](projects-source/day20/snake-game-part-1/readme.md)
### R1D21
Today I finished coding the snake project. This was a great opportunity to learn about object-oriented programming. [View readme.](projects-source/day21/snake-game-part-2/readme.md)
### R1D22
Today's program is a pong game! This was good practice with everything from loops, functions, classes, objects, and graphics module. [View readme.](projects-source/day22/pong/readme.md)
### R1D23
I wrote a fun game where a player has to try to make it across a road without getting run over by cars. [View readme.](projects-source/day23/turtle-crossing/readme.md)
### R1D24
I did a number of things today.

The first is that I added a high score system to the snake game. High scores should now carry over from game to game, if you exit the program and run it again.

The second thing is not really anything. It is just a practice with files.

The last thing I worked on today was a sort of sample mail merger program. [View readme.](projects-source/day24/mail-merge-project/readme.md)
### R1D25
Today was kind of slow for me. The main thing I did was to experiment with Pandas to get familiar with common methods.

A small project I wrote was a squirrel aggregating program that gathers how many of each color exists from a dataset provided. It then wrote the results back to a CSV file.
### R1D26
Today I wrote a game where the aim is to guess all 50 states in the US. It's kind of fun. It will then generate a file of states you missed.

I also wrote a program that will give a list of phonetic codes for a word you, the user, enters. For example, "edgar" would give something like "echo delta golf alpha romeo"
### R1D27
It has been a week since I have been able to program. Power and water went out last week, so I am just now getting back to it.

Today I started learning about TKInter in Python. I wrote a simple mile to km converter. [View readme.](projects-source/day27/mile-to-km/readme.md)
### R1D28
I wrote a Pomodoro GUI application. The program is designed to increase productivity. It has two simple buttons, a start and reset button. These buttons control timers that can be used to keep track of work and break periods for you, the user.

The common work flow for a pomodoro application is using 25 minutes for uninterrupted work, 5 minutes for a short break, and after 4 "pomodoros," you may take a long break of 20 minutes.
### R1D29
Today I wrote a Password Manager. It's a GUI with inputs and buttons. At the moment, it will generate passwords and save entries to a file. The passwords are not hidden, so I recommend not using this for super security-based applications.
### R1D30
Today I learned about errors and handling them with exceptions.

I began with adding some exception handling to my old Nato Alphabet project. It now handles input that might not be correct.

I also added another feature to the project I did yesterday, the Password Manager. It now searches for websites you might have saved. And it is now using json data.
### R1D31
Today was kind of a lazy day.

I wrote code to render UI for a flash card program. The rest will be done on day 32. Also tomorrow, I am planning to take on another project to make up for today.
### R1D32
I know, I know. I'm falling behind! But I am trying my best.

Today I finished my day 31 project, which is a simple flash card program. It works on a timer. See if you know some of the french words. If you do, the words will not come up again.
### R1D33
Today I wrote two programs. First I wrote a program to send motivational quotes (can be adjusted to send any one day of the week).

I also wrote a program that sends someone a birthday wish. It uses CSV file to keep track of people.
### R1D34
I worked on two little programs today.

The first was a simple funny Kanye quotes app. See what Kanye West has to say.

The second is a bit more serious and cool. It sends an email when the ISS, International Space Station, is right above your location. It uses latitude and longitude to determine your location. Location is not automatically detected, but if you can manage to get your coordinates, they can be filled in as constants, and you can be informed when the ISS is near!
### R1D35
Today I worked on a GUI version of the quiz application. It is 95 percent complete. [View readme.](projects-source/day35/quizzler-app/readme.md)
### R1D36
Today I was very productive. I learned about authenticating to apps, if authentication is needed, using API keys and other information.

That lead me to create a umbrella alert app. When ran, the application will check a weather api, and notify you if you need an umbrella via text message. It's a simple app, but I'm glad this gives me an opportunity to learn about APIs.
### R1D37
Today I wrote a cool app to track stock for Tesla from last two days. [View readme.](projects-source/day37/stock-news/readme.md)
### R1D38
Most of what I did today was to learn about sending requests. I learned about post, delete, put, and basic get requests. The API I learned from is Pixela, an app which allows someone to track an activity.

I learned to create a user, create a graph, and create an entry for the activity. Also, deleting an entry is learned. This program could be extened beyond what I did here, but that's what I did today. Very productive!
### R1D39
I wrote an exercise tracking app. You basically type in a plain English sentence which describes what exercise activity you performed, and the program will send that to a Google Sheet. It is more API practice.
### R1D40
I was away yestertday with some bladder thing, which was supposed to be real day 40. But I'm getting better. Today I started a flight finder project.

The flight finder project is in multiple complex parts. It is divided into classes. Today I worked on writing iata codes to a Google Sheet.

Tomorrow should be spent finishing it up with text messages and such.
### R1D41
Today I finished the major functionality of the Flight Deals application. It should send an SMS message if it finds cheaper prices than those listed in a Google sheet departing from London.
### R1D42
Today I added some functionality to our flight deals program. Users can now sign up with their email addresses, and if the flight program finds any good deals, it will send them to the users.

At the moment, it only works when flying from London. It could be expanded to work from any other city.
### R1D43
Today was a busy day! The first project I worked on was a movie scraper. I essentially grabbed 100 of the best movies to watch from a website and practiced my web scraping abilities. [View readme.](projects-source/day43/movie-scraper/readme.md)

I also worked on a playlist creator. It is kind of cool. It asks the user what date in the past from when they want to view songs, and a Spotify playlist is generated for them.
### R1D44
Today I worked on more web scraping. I worked on an application to send an email if the price of an item, a random item, has a price lower than $1500.

This could potentially be used for practically any item and price threshold. But for this purpose, I used a random gaming computer.
### R1D45
Today I worked on two simple projects. Both are designed to practice using the Selenium library.

The first project is a simple program to tell you how many articles are on Wikipedia.

The second project is a simple Cookie Clicker player. It will click cookie generator for you indefinitely.
### R1D46
Today I worked on an application to scrape LinkedIn using Selenium. This was an exercise to automate job search.

I didn't really want to apply for jobs at the moment, so the purpose of this program was just to find potential companies at which I could apply in the future. I generated a search filter for Python Developer jobs.

All one needs to do is enter their credentials into the appropriate constants in the Python file, and watch the program look for a few companies that might offer Python jobs. You could potentially use other search filters, provided they are generated on the LinkedIn website first. This shows much potential for automation. And I could certainly extend it to auto-apply to jobs for me.
### R1D47
Today I worked on an auto Tinder swiper. Well, it actually just automates disliking people. I had some hesitation doing this project, but I wanted to learn more about Selenium.

I am not actually on Tinder, but I created a throwaway account. I don't want to mess with people's feelings after all.

At the moment, a user can log in, and successfully get to the main screen to start liking or disliking users. I almost have the actual disliking functionality down. I can probably finish tomorrow.
### R1D48
Today's project was simple. I wrote a Twitter complaint bot. It complains if my current Internet speed is lower than what my ISP advertises for me. And of course, it is.
