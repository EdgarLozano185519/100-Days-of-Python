The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 19, Tuesday, 2021.

## Log

### R1D1
Worked on a program that generates a cool band name. [View readme.](projects-source/day1-band-name-generator/readme.md)
### R1D2
Worked on a program to calculate how much someone owes including tip. [View readme.](projects-source/day2/tip-calculator/readme.md)
### R1D3
Didn't work on complex program, but did two smaller programs.

I worked on a tool to tell you if a number is even or odd. [View readme.](projects-source/day3/even-odd/readme.md)

I worked on a program to tell your weight based on BMI. [View readme.](projects-source/day3/bmi-calculator/readme.md)
### R1D4
I did two programs today.

I worked on a rock-paper-scissors game. [View readme.](projects-source/day4/rock-paper-scissors/readme.md)

And I worked on a coin-toss program to test my use of the random library. [View readme.](projects-source/coin-toss/readme.md)
### R1D5
Today was fun. I worked on a simple password generator! [View readme.](projects-source/day5/simple-password-generator/readme.md)

I also worked on a tool to tell you which is the high score in a list of scores.
### R1D6
First program was written to add even numbers between 1 and 100. Nice little program to practice my math with Python.

Second program I wrote was the Fizz Buzz program to practice order of conditionals.

Final program I wrote today was a Hangman application! That was fun. [View readme.](projects-source/day6/hangman/readme.md)
### R1D7
Today I wrote a Caesar Cypher program that will encrypt and decrypt a word using any shift value. [View readme.](projects-source/day7/caesar-cypher/readme.md)
### R1D8
Today I wrote a silent auction program to display highest bidder. [View readme.](projects-source/day8/silent-auction/readme.md)

I also wrote a small program to tell you if a number is a prime number.
### R1D9
I wrote a simple four-operation calculator. [View readme.](projects-source/day9/calculator/readme.md)

I also wrote a fun little game called Treasure Island. Feel free to clone and run the game to see how fun it is!
### R1D10
Today I wrote a version of the Black Jack game! So fun. I was able to apply loops, functions, and using the random library. [View readme.](projects-source/day10/black-jack/readme.md)
### R1D11
Today was a fun guessing game! I practiced more loops and variable scope. [View readme.](projects-source/day11/guessing-game/readme.md)
### R1D12
Today I started on a complex project. I started to develop the beginning stages of a markdown to HTML converter.

This will give me an opportunity to work with file manipulation libraries, regular expressions, and more intermediate concepts. I will return to this from time to time as it may be useful in creating blog posts for a website I run.

Today, I finished working on a function that is supposed to detect when headings are found and convert them from markdown to HTML string. I also started on a function to tell whether a string contains a potential link.

I am resuming the main curriculum I've been following starting tomorrow.
### R1D13
Today I worked on a fun game that allows a player to guess which of two social media accounts might have more followers. [View readme.](projects-source/day13/higher-lower/readme.md)
### R1D14
Today I worked on a fun virtual coffee machine. It was pretty fun getting to see how I could make it without using functions. [View readme.](projects-source/day14/coffee-machine/readme.md)
### R1D15
Today, I did the exact same project as yesterday. The only difference is that I used Object Oriented Programming to deliver the awesome coffee to you. [View readme.](projects-source/day15/oop-coffee-machine/readme.md)
### R1D16
Today I wrote a quiz game in Python. I used OOP concepts to design a question class, and a quizzer class. [View readme.](projects-source/day16/quiz-game/readme.md)
### R1D17
Today I experimented with Turtle graphics, a library as part of the Python library. It was fun getting to try to draw things on the screen using a turtle. The main project was a Hurst Paiting sort of project in which dots are drawn on the screen with varying colors and patterns. [View readme.](projects-source/day17/hurst-painting/readme.md)
### R1D18
OK. I have to admit, today was kind of an easier day. I didn't exactly do full project coding, but I spent a lot of time learning about packages, modules, and libraries. I created a package containing a speech library to speak things, which might be useful to some users.

I made use of a library known as Tolk, which has screen reader capabilities.

I also worked on a sample turtle graphics program that moves a turtle forward, making use of the turtle graphics and the screen reader library.
### R1D19
I wrote a etch-a-sketch application today using turtle graphics! It just draws on the screen using a  cool turtle figure. It was a fun project! [View readme.](projects-source/day19/etch-a-sketch/readme.md)
### R1D20
The first project I worked on today was a turtle racing game. Launch the application, type the color you think is going to win, and press the r key on the keyboard to watch the race and see if your bet was correct.

The second project is part 1 of a snake game project. [View readme.](projects-source/day20/snake-game-part-1/readme.md)
### R1D21
Today I finished coding the snake project. This was a great opportunity to learn about object-oriented programming. [View readme.](projects-source/day21/snake-game-part-2/readme.md)
